# FRESH 2026 - Bobby the Bilingual Box

FRC Team 1811’s 2026 competition robot codebase.

Also known as Bobby the Box.
For close friends, just Bobby.
Pronouns: She/Her.

Fully state-driven.  
Fully superstructured.  
Fully locked in.

This season we refined the control structure to make the robot more intentional and scalable.

# 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

We don’t bind buttons straight to motors anymore.

We define intent.

States like `PREP_SHOT`, `INTAKING`, `APPROACHING_TOWER` describe what the robot is trying to accomplish. The superstructure then coordinates drivetrain, shooter, intake, and everything else accordingly.

Clean. Predictable. Scalable.

Teleop and auto share logic.  
Subsystems don’t fight each other.  
And we’re not duct-taping commands together mid-event anymore.

We’re building like we plan to keep winning with it.

# ➕ Adding a New State

States are the brain of this robot.

Adding a new state is easy-peasy, but requires a little bit of thinking.

Here’s the process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1️⃣ Define the State

Go to:

    superstructure/robot_state.py

Add your new enum value inside `RobotState`.

Example:

``` python
class RobotState(Enum):
    ...
    ALIGNING_TO_TARGET = 99
```

Keep it descriptive.  
Make it very specific.

Bad:

``` python
RUN_SHOOTER_FAST
```

Good:

``` python
PREP_SHOT
ALIGNING_TO_TARGET
APPROACHING_TOWER
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ Route It in `update()`

Open:

    superstructure/superstructure.py

Inside the `update()` method, add your state to the routing logic:

``` python
elif self.robot_state == RobotState.ALIGNING_TO_TARGET:
    self._handle_aligning_to_target()
```

If it logically belongs with other grouped states (like elevator
states), add it to that list instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3️⃣ Create the Handler

Still inside `superstructure.py`, define the handler:

``` python
def _handle_aligning_to_target(self):
    if not self.hasVision or not self.hasDrivetrain:
        return

    self.drivetrain.alignToTarget(self.vision)
```

Handlers should:

-   Coordinate subsystems  
-   Not contain low-level hardware code  
-   Not bypass subsystem safety checks

Subsystems execute.  
Superstructure decides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4️⃣ (Optional) Add Readiness Logic

If your new state affects robot readiness (for example shooter ready, elevator at target, etc.), update `_update_readiness()` accordingly.
This is the correct place to add safety checks, gating logic, or state-based conditions.
If you introduce a new readiness flag, make sure to also add it to the `RobotReadiness` data class located in:
    superstructure/robot_state.py
All readiness values should live inside `RobotReadiness`. Please don't scatter them all over the codebase.

Keep readiness centralized.

This keeps rumble logic, feed gating, and state transitions consistent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5️⃣ Transition Properly

To enter your new state:

``` python
self.superstructure.setState(RobotState.ALIGNING_TO_TARGET)
```

Or create a reusable command:

``` python
self.superstructure.createStateCommand(RobotState.ALIGNING_TO_TARGET)
```

Do NOT:

-   Call subsystem motors directly from button bindings  
-   Mix superstructure logic inside commands

Intent flows through state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Design Guidelines

When adding a state, ask:

-   Is this a robot intention?  
-   Can teleop and auto reuse it?

If yes -> it belongs as a state.

# ⚙ Hardware Overview

## 🔄 Drivetrain - Kraken Swerve

Located in `subsystems/drive/`

- Drive Motors: Kraken X60  
- Steer Motors: Kraken X44  
- Holonomic swerve drive  
- Field-relative control  
- Vision-assisted alignment  
- Integrated scoring states  

Yes, it’s fast.  
Yes, it tracks.  
Yes, it behaves.

---

## 🎯 Shooter System

Located in `subsystems/shooter/`

- Shooter Motor: Kraken X60  
- Closed-loop velocity control  
- State-gated firing  
- Coordinated indexing  
- Vision-aware prep

We don’t just press shoot and pray.  
The robot confirms it’s ready.

---

## 📦 Indexer

Located in `subsystems/shooter/`

- Motor: Brushed motor via SparkMax  
- Controlled by superstructure  
- Only feeds when shooter conditions are met  

No panic feeding. No chaos cycling.

---

## 😵‍💫 Agitator

Located in `subsystems/shooter/`

- Motor: NEO Brusheless motor via SparkMax
- Runs when Indexer is running

It shakey-shakey, we like it when it shakey-shakey.

---

## 🟢 Intake

Located in `subsystems/intake/`

- Motor: Brushed motor via SparkMax  
- Pneumatic deployment system  
- State-aware deployment logic  
- Auto-integrated  

It deploys when it should.  
It retracts when it should.  
Ground intake energy handled.

---

## 🧗 Climber

Located in `subsystems/climber/`

- Pneumatic airbrake system  
- Elevator coordination  
- Manual + autonomous states  

We like controlled climbs.  
No last-second “hope this works” moments.

---

## 👁 Vision System

Located in `subsystems/vision/`

- Limelight  
- AprilTag localization  
- Drivetrain-following states

# ⚠ IMPORTANT WARNINGS (PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU FAFO)

## 🔧 Robot-Specific Constants

**ALL CONSTANTS IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE ROBOT-SPECIFIC.**

Every value in `constants/` is tuned for:

- Our gear ratios  
- Our inversions  
- Our encoder offsets  
- Our CAN IDs  
- Our robot dimensions  
- Our pneumatics  

If you copy this without changing constants… respectfully… that’s wild.

You MUST:

- Verify CAN IDs  
- Verify inversions  
- Verify encoder offsets  
- Retune all PID values  
- Confirm dimensions  

Failure to update constants may result in:

- Mechanism damage  
- Uncontrolled motion  
- Incorrect field positioning  
- Serious injury  

Yes. Injury.

Misconfigured control loops can cause sudden, high-speed robot movement.

By using this repository, you accept full responsibility for safe implementation.  
FRC Team 1811 is not liable for damage, injury, or misuse.

This is not a plug-and-play template.  
This is architecture.

## 🔐 Phoenix 6 Pro Requirement

This robot uses CTRE Phoenix 6 Pro features.

Without:

- A valid Phoenix Pro license  
- Correct Phoenix installation  
- Matching firmware  

Some motors and advanced control modes will not behave properly.

Set up your CTRE stack correctly before deploying.

We are not debugging your licensing.

# 🤝 How to Contribute

Welcome.

If you're contributing, that means you care about building something clean. We appreciate that.

This robot runs on a state-driven architecture. Respect the structure.

## 🧠 Before You Add Code

- Do not bypass the superstructure.
- Do not bind buttons directly to motor outputs.
- Do not hardcode constants outside `constants/`.
- If you’re unsure where something belongs: ask.

We build systems here. Not shortcuts.

---

## 🗂 Organization Rules

- `subsystems/` -> Hardware logic  
- `commands/` -> Behaviors  
- `superstructure/` -> Robot intent coordination  
- `constants/` -> Tunable values  
- `utils/` -> Helper tools  

If it feels like a hack, it probably is.

---

## 🧪 Test First

- Run simulation before deploying.
- Verify motor directions after mechanical changes.

The robot moves fast.  
Mistakes move faster.

---

Keep it readable.  
Keep it intentional.  
Keep it elite.

NOTE: Yes, drivetrainsubsystem.py and phoenixswervemodule.py are very NOT readable and friendly, but if I touch it, it breaks <3 If it works, don't touch it right...
